# Predictive Drug Treatment Analysis

This repository offers analytical solutions to key challenges in drug treatment. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of electronic health records, we extract valuable insights to predict drug eligibility, analyze treatment drop-offs, and uncover prescription trends.

## Overview

The project is divided into three main problems:

### Problem 1: Eligibility Prediction for "Target Drug"
Develop a predictive model to determine if a patient will be eligible for "Target Drug" within the next 30 days. This model assists physicians in making informed treatment decisions.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and transform raw patient data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features from patients' medical histories.
- **Model Development:** Train machine learning models on historical data.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics and generate predictions.

### Problem 2: Treatment Drop-off Analysis
Examine the factors contributing to patients discontinuing "Target Drug" and measure drop-off rates over time.

- **Drop-off Calculation:** Compute monthly discontinuation rates.
- **Event Analysis:** Identify key factors and events that lead to treatment discontinuation.

### Problem 3: Prescription Pattern Analysis
Analyze prescription trends to reveal how "Target Drug" is administered over time.

- **Data Preparation:** Extract prescription-related data.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Apply clustering techniques to discover distinct prescription patterns.
- **Visualization:** Map trends over time, with months on the X-axis and the number of prescriptions on the Y-axis.
